brain-python-interface (a.k.a. bmi3d)
====================================
This package contains Python code to run electrophysiology behavioral tasks,
with emphasis on brain-machine interface (BMIs) tasks. This package differs 
from other similar packages (e.g., BCI2000--http://www.schalklab.org/research/bci2000) 
in that it is primarily intended for intracortical BMI experiments. 

This package has been used with the following recording systems:
- Omniplex neural recording system (Plexon, Inc.). 
- Blackrock NeuroPort
